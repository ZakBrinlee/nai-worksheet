### Take Home Worksheet

Role: Sr. Web Developer

#### Scenerio:
Below is an HTML document from a hypothetical eCommerce business&#39;s product
page. For each question, please write an explanation of how you would approach
the problem and what considerations or assumptions.

Clear and concise explanations and code comments are encouraged. Please use
the scripting language of your choice, either Javascript or **Typescript**.

#### Questions:
1. Each HTML element with the class `cart-item` contains a price and quantity of each item within a user's cart. Please write a function that calculates the cart's total cost and outputs the result in the `js-cart-total` element.

2. Write a function that sends a POST request to `https://thirdparty.com/track` whenever a user clicks the `Add to Cart` button. The HTTP request should include a JSON payload that contains the client `timestamp of the event`, `item_id`, and `cart_id`.

3. Identify the areas of the page that are classified as "dynamic," meaning they vary between users, devices, and inventory status.

4. Develop a feature to keep a list of the five most recently viewed products a user has visited. This information should persist across sessions.

5. Please explain how you would approach web performance optimization for this page. Use creative liberty here; the possibilities are endless!
